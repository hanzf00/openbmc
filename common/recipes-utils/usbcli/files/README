"usbcli" is mainly designed for debugging USB-to-SPI FPGA devices.

It's NOT intended to be called from other scripts or programs to access
USB devices: the command line interface may change in the future.

If you need to access USB devices in your program, please use libusb or
you may need a USB driver in kernel space.
