Introduction:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fw_upgrader tool provides a utility to upgrade Firmwares from BMC. This tool
is configuration driven defined in jsons.


What is needed for upgrade?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Upgradable Firmwares
2) Jsons that define the Firmware:
fw_upgrader is designed to accept 2 jsons of the filenames:

> *"_fw_versions.json"
- Json file that defines the FW version and FW files and its hash itself.
> *"_fw_manifest.json"
- Json that defines the orchestration of 1) above. Example the commands that can
pull versions and upgrade form BMC for a FW


About Jsons:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both of the 2 json are well-defined and fw-upgrade tool assumes they comply
with json schemas defined in
> /tools/fw_upgrade/fw_manifest_schema.json
> /tools/fw_upgrade/fw_version_schema.json

How to generate jsons:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every platform can have multiple versions and combinations of the FW versions
itself. Create the jsons based on the schema defined here. Examples:
meta-facebook/meta-minipack/recipes-utils/openbmc-utils/files/fw-upgrade/minipack_fw_manifest.json
meta-facebook/meta-minipack/recipes-utils/openbmc-utils/files/fw-upgrade/minipack_fw_versions.json.json

Usage:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Copy all the *.py files under tools/fw_upgrade to BMC.
2) Download all the FW binaries and jsons to the same path
3) Launch the script using:
python fw_main.py --help
